PNGs support more colours than GIF – including 24bit and 48 bit colours. And for BMP is it does not degrade when saved multiple times like JPEG does and it supported by virtually every device. Advantages of the GIF is it widely supported Internet standard and lossless compression and transparency supported.
		</p>
		<h1>disadvantages</h1>
		<p>
			Disadvantages of the PNG is it only support fix images unlike the gif file type that supports both still and moving images. Disadvantages of the BMP is it no compression, which results in very large files and it not supported by Web browsers.
